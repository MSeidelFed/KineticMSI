\title{A function to sort previous to unification independent kMSI samples according to enrichment percentage or any other kind of proxy for tracer incorporation}
\usage{
EnrichmentSortedSamplingMSI(
  path,
  PatternEnrichment = "MeanEnrichment.csv",
  RepsOrPath = c("reps", "path"),
  featureChoice = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{parent directory were all enrichment files are contained, digs within recursive folders.}

\item{PatternEnrichment}{defaults to "MeanEnrichment". Inherits from parent function.}

\item{RepsOrPath}{defines whether the input is a vector with paths to individual reps or already a path itself.}

\item{featureChoice}{Allows selecting the index of a feature of interest to be sorted.}
}
\description{
This function allows KineticMSI functions to build a matrix with independent samples by unifying them.
